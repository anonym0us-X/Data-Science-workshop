# Data-Science-workshop
This repository is the collection of the works I have performed during the workshop entitled "Empowering insights: Data science and Big data analysis".

## Key concepts I learnt:
✅ Applied python programming to industrial usage.
✅ Using Jupyter-notebook & google collab, thus importing libraries to its environmnet.
✅ Import a dataset for local machine and also importing a dataset from hosted services.
✅ Data cleaning procedure using the SQL queries.
✅ Visualization of the dataset using the matplotlib library

## Getting started:
If you are working locally on vs code or other applications:

1. Installling of Python from python officical website. (python.org)
2. Install virtual environment for python using the command: pip install virtualenv
3. Activate the environment using "venv/Scripts/activate" on the powershell (note: venv is my virtual environment name change it according to yours)

## Else:
1. Use the jupyter-notebook throught the Anaconda distribution.
2. Use google collab.

I have used libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib which are pre-installed in both Anaconda distro and the google collab.
